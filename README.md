# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 17, 2026

Axora's Hub ("the App") is a free, fan-made application developed by KingOfAxora. This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. I do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to external servers.

# 1. Information Collection and Use

I do not collect any personal information.

The App functions entirely offline regarding your character data. All data created within the App (Character Sheets, Save Files, etc.) is stored locally on your device in .json format. I (the developer) have no access to your characters, your saves, or your device files.

1.1 Local Storage

The App uses your device's internal storage to save your progress.

Files: Character data is saved as .json files in the App's private directory or selected public directories.

Deletion: Uninstalling the App or clearing the App's storage via Android Settings will permanently delete these local files unless you have manually backed them up elsewhere.

# 2. Third-Party Services

While the App itself does not collect data, it does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you (e.g., for crash reporting or app functionality).

# 3. Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app, I may collect data and information (through third-party products like Google Play Console) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

# 4. Links to Other Sites

This Service contains links to other sites (e.g., YouTube, Ko-fi/Buy Me a Coffee for voluntary donations). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

Important: Donations are voluntary "peer-to-peer" support. No goods, services, or digital features are exchanged for these payments.

# 6. Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

# 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
